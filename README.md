# nucleo-l4r5zi-sine-tflite

This project is an example on how to run a Machine Learning model built by TensorFlow on tiny microcontrollers. We use the development board [NUCLEO STM32L4R5ZI](https://www.st.com/en/evaluation-tools/nucleo-l4r5zi.html#overview) with STM32CubeIDE for demonstration.

- The Machine Learning model was trained using generated sine data from `Hello World` example on tensorflow: https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/tree/master/tensorflow/lite/micro/examples/hello_world/train

- The project was inspired from the video: [TinyML: Getting Started with TensorFlow Lite for Microcontrollers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gDFWCxrJruQ&t=415s)
